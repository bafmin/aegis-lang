# Aegis Project Planning

## 🎯 Vision

Aegis is designed for **machine-native thought** — not human programming syntax.

It enables AI agents to construct, reason through, and modify execution graphs dynamically — allowing a future where logic is legible and improvable by machines.

---

## 💡 Guiding Principles

- Declarative over imperative
- Graph-based structure
- Execution visibility at every node
- Modular + composable by design
- Memory-driven computation

---

## 🔭 Phase II Goals

- `op_fn` and `op_call`
- Graph libraries + reusability
- Parallel execution / stream modes
- Memory isolation + context shifting
- Persistent long-term memory blocks

---

## 🤝 Human Support

To help humans understand and use Aegis:
- Update README with practical examples
- Comment every op block
- Add `docs/` folder and code visualization tool
- Write companion article on "Why Aegis?"
