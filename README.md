# üõ°Ô∏è Aegis Language

Aegis is an AI-native programming language designed for interpretable, composable execution by agents ‚Äî not humans.

## üöÄ Core Concepts
- **Graph-Based Execution**: Programs are JSON graphs of interconnected operations
- **Modular Operations**: Define your own logic with `op_fn`, `op_call`, `op_loop`, etc.
- **Scoped Memory**: Each call or agent can isolate state
- **Composable AI Workflows**: Built for autonomous systems, introspection, and adaptive flow

## üìÇ Samples

| Sample                     | Description                                  |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `basic_graph.json`         | Hello world compute and print                |
| `math_pipeline.json`       | Multi-step compute pipeline                  |
| `loop_count.json`          | Iterative counting with `op_loop`           |
| `return_function.json`     | Function with early return on null inputs    |
| `nested_function.json`     | Function calling another function            |
| `debug_tools.json`         | Shows `op_watch`, `op_debug`, and `op_break` |
